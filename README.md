About
-----

The goal of this project is to provide a beautiful looking Arch Linux desktop system with some preconfigured options to ease the process of customizing the OS and using it as a daily workspace. Especially users coming from Max OSX should enjoy the look & feel of Juicy Linux although it is not the idea of imitating OSX.   

Juicy Linux is first of all made for developers and designers while other audience is welcome as well. 

The project's target can be summarized as follows:
- fully customized awesome looking Gnome Desktop Environment
- OSX like Expose window overview, desktop dock and mouse gestures
- preconfigured to ease the installation of non-Linux design software like Photoshop
- while lightweight as Arch Linux itself some developer's and designer's tools like Sublime Text 3 are already installed
